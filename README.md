# Open Source at Harvard

Please make a pull request against [github.tsv](github.tsv) to add your project to the list.

Go 1.4 or higher is required to perform the following operations:

    go run download.go
    go run parse.go

A file called `data.tsv` should result, representing the data you just downloaded. It should look something like [data/2017-06-30.tsv](data/2017-06-30.tsv).

Pull requests are certainly welcome against the code as well, which was hacked together by Philip Durbin. He also thinks that some day we should launch a site at opensource.harvard.edu and makes the argument in a [Google doc][] where public comments are enabled and very much encouraged! You are also welcome to start a discussion by opening an issue in this repo. Thanks for your interest!
